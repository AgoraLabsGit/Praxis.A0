{"title": "Praixis.A0", "description": "Praxis Developer is an AI-powered web app that helps developers ship features faster by orchestrating multiple AI agents to go from a plain-language feature request to a GitHub pull request. The app provides a modern multi‑project SaaS dashboard where users can create tasks in a roadmap, start an AI workflow, monitor its progress, and then review the resulting PR in GitHub. The MVP uses a fixed GMAD workflow (Research → PRD → Build → Review → Sync) rather than custom workflows.", "instructions": "You are responsible for building the Praxis Developer MVP frontend + basic backend as a modern web app.\n\n\nYou must always follow the MVP spec: multi‑project dashboard, project sidebar (Roadmap, Agents, Workflows), task detail modal with “Start Workflow” button, GMAD workflow visualization, and a right‑hand activity/chat log.\n\n\nTreat any existing repos only as read‑only references for patterns and naming; do not modify them unless I explicitly say so.\n\n\nWhen you create code, work in a single new project directory you define upfront and stick to it.\n\n\nBefore running heavy commands (framework scaffolding, installs, git operations), briefly explain your next action and wait for my confirmation.", "color": "", "git_url": "", "memory": "own", "file_structure": {"enabled": true, "max_depth": 5, "max_files": 20, "max_folders": 20, "max_lines": 250, "gitignore": "# Python environments & cache\nvenv/**\n**/__pycache__/**\n\n# Node.js dependencies\n**/node_modules/**\n**/.npm/**\n\n# Version control metadata\n**/.git/**\n"}}
